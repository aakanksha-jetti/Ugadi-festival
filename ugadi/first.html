            <h2>About Ugadi</h2>
            <p>Ugadi, also known as Yugadi, signifies the Hindu New Year, marking a fresh start and the arrival of spring. Falling in late March or early April, it coincides with the Chaitra month in the lunisolar calendar. Some believe it commemorates the creation of the universe, while others associate it with Lord Rama's victory. Traditions include listening to astrological predictions (panchanga), sharing a unique bittersweet dish (Ugadi Pachadi) symbolizing life's experiences, and decorating homes with mango leaf toranas for good luck. People wear new clothes, clean their homes, and create colorful rangoli or kolam patterns to welcome prosperity. Visits to temples, seeking blessings from elders, and exchanging greetings with loved ones further strengthen the spirit of community and hope for a bountiful year ahead. Celebrated with regional variations across India, Ugadi is a vibrant festival that ushers in new beginnings and optimism.</p>
